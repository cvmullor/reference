Code used in the work "One is not enough: on the effects of reference genome for the mapping and subsequent analyses of short-reads"

Overview of the code used in [Valiente-Mullor C et al. One is not enough: on the effects of reference genome for the mapping and subsequent analyses of short-reads. BioRxiv:2020.04.14.041004 [Preprint]. 2020.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041004v1). Usage is detailed in the header section of each script.

The workflow is summarized in the Figure below (Fig 1).
